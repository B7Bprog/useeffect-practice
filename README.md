# useEffect practice tasks

- To set up this project, run `npm install` in your terminal in the main folder of the project.

- To start the app, run `npm run dev`, then open the link (http://localhost:5173/) in Chrome.

- You can find 4 different components in the 'components' folder and your task is to debug/complete the `useEffect()` call to render the page as described in the description for each exercise.

  Start by reading the task in the component (for example in 'components/Task1.jsx'), then enable the task by importing the component. You may wish to leave only one task uncommented at a time.

### _Before starting to work on these tasks, it's recommended to take another look at the useEffect hook in our notes here (https://notes.northcoders.com/courses/js-front-end/useEffect)_
